#Coin Game for Greedy Emon

Here is the video for my Greedy Emon's arduino part:

This is an interactive installation designed for collecting tips. 
When customers come close to it, the cat will shake his hands to attract customers' attention. 
When customers throw coins into its head, the cat will rotate his head and begin to smile.
Then, he will be sad again.

In the openframeworks part, I design a coin collecting game to connect with the cat. 
When he shakes arm, the cat head on the screen will shake from left to right.
When people throw a coin into his head, there will be a "coin rain" in the game
people can use the "left and right key" to control the cat head to collect the coins.
And there is a counter in the left corner.
Here are the demos for the game
